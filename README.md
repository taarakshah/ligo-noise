# ligo-noise
Implement RNN / LSTM on simulated wave data. This contains my part of a group project that worked with LIGO (Laser Inferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) data.

In this project, I artificially create a wave signal and add increasingly complex random noise to it to see which neural networks can extract the true signal the best. The methods are described in the "RNN-LSTM-with-keras" notebook.

Methods: signal processing, recurrent neural network (RNN), long-short term memory (LSTM), power spectral density
